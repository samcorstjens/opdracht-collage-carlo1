# All-Star
*Somebody* once told me the world is gonna *roll me*
I ain't the __sharpest__ tool in the shed
She was looking kind of **dumb** with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead


#Beautiful star

__Where__ ever you go,
Where ever you are,
I just look at the **sky**,
And search for the Most Beautiful Star ....
